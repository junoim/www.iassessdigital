                    <h2><b>WHAT IS VAALO TA & HOW DOES IT WORK?</b></h2>
                    VAALO TA (Voice AI Assistant for LifelineRx Operations) is a mobile-based AI-powered healthcare assistant that reads and interprets prescriptions, reminds users to take medication, and provides voice-guided instructions. It especially caters to senior citizens, children, and those with limited education — helping bridge the gap between complex medical prescriptions and accessible, everyday healthcare.
                    <h3><i>Why It's Needed:</i></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand handwritten prescriptions.</li>
                        <li>Keep track of dosages and timing.</li>
                        <li>Identify alternative medications or brand options.</li>
                        <li>Get reminders, especially in regional languages</li>
                    </ul>
                    VAALO TA turns treatment into action — with the help of AI, OCR, voice alarms, and reminders.
