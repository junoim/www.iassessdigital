                    <h2><b>WHAT IS PHISHBUSTER & HOW DOES IT WORK?</b></h2>
                    PhishBuster is an interactive, gamified cybersecurity platform designed to empower users in identifying and defending against phishing attacks. It replaces outdated, passive awareness sessions with an engaging, game-like experience built on real-world attack simulations, AI personalization, and progressive learning.
                    <br>
                    <h3><b>Why It's Needed:</b></h3>
                    Phishing remains one of the most dangerous and successful cyberattack methods globally. While organizations invest heavily in security infrastructure, the human element remains vulnerable. PhishBuster addresses this by building recognition skills, encouraging secure habits, and boosting cybersecurity awareness through motivation, habit-building, and immersive experiences.
